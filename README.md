##  Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables.

create a .env file that includes the following:
    
    *  NODE_ENV - set to "development" until ready for "production"
    *  TWILIO_ID - This app uses twillio to send text messages. You can get your own keys by going to [Twillio.com](https://twilio.com)
    *  TWILIO_AUTH -  see above.
    *  VAPID_PRIVATE - `yarn global add web-push` then `web-push generate-vapid-keys`
    *  VAPID_PUBLIC - see above
    *  GEO_CODE_KEY - To get your own Geocode keys go to [opencagedata](https://opencagedata.com/users/sign_up)
    *  JWT_SECRET - "Fireflight Secret"  This is a terrible secret. Also, we should use a third-party auth library.*
